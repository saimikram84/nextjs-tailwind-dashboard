# Next.js & TailwindCSS Admin Dashboard
This is a powerful and flexible admin dashboard template built with Next.js and TailwindCSS. It's designed for creating high-performance, responsive admin panels with a modern UI/UX.

## Features

- **Next.js for Server-Side Rendering**: Enjoy the SEO and performance benefits of server-side rendering.
- **TailwindCSS for Styling**: Utilize the utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Built-in theme switcher for dark and light mode.
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Pre-built widgets for analytics, charts, and more.
- **Authentication**: Sample authentication flow with NextAuth.
- **SEO Optimized**: SEO-friendly pages with Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
